class CallbackBase:
    """Base class for callbacks that execute something before/after training.

    Allows overwriting `before_training` and `after_training`.

    If the callback is stateful (i.e., it tracks something across the training process that needs to be loaded if the
    run is resumed), there are two ways to implement loading the callback state:

    * `state_dict`: write current state into a state dict. When the trainer saves the current checkpoint to the disk,
      it will also store the `state_dict` of all callbacks within the trainer `state_dict`. Once a run is resumed, a
      callback can load its state from the previously stored `state_dict` by overwriting the `load_state_dict`.

    * `resume_from_checkpoint`: If a callback is storing large files onto the disk, it would be redundant to also
      store them within its `state_dict`. Therefore, this method is called on resume to allow callbacks to load their
      state from files on the disk.

    Callbacks have access to a `LogWriter`, with which callbacks can log metrics. The `LogWriter` is a singleton.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python

            # THIS IS INSIDE A CUSTOM CALLBACK

            # log only to experiment tracker, not stdout
            self.writer.add_scalar(key="classification_accuracy", value=0.2)
            # log to experiment tracker and stdout (as "0.24")
            self.writer.add_scalar(
                key="classification_accuracy",
                value=0.23623,
                logger=self.logger,
                format_str=".2f",
            )

    Note:
        As evaluations are pretty much always done in torch.no_grad() contexts, the hooks implemented by callbacks
        are always executed within a torch.no_grad() context.
