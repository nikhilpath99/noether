class CheckpointWriter:
    """Class to easily write checkpoints in a structured way to the disk.

    Each `Model` will be stored in a separate file where additionally weights and optimizer state are also
    separate files. This allows flexible storing of model states without producing files that are never needed after
    training. For example, to resume runs, one need the model weights and optimizer states. However, storing
    optimizer states for all checkpoints is expensive as optimizer states are commonly 2x as large as only the weights.

    To illustrate the flexibility, consider the use-case of training an autoencoder model where the goal is to train
    a good encoder that should then be used for another task. This model is implemented via a class `Autoencoder` that
    inherits from `CompositeModel` and contains two submodels, an encoder and decoder (both which inherit from
    `Model`). During training, we want to store the following files to the disk:
    - The encoder weights after every 10 epochs to evaluate performance at various training lengths.
    - The latest weights and optimizer states of encoder and decoder to allow resuming a run if it crashes.
    The CheckpointWriter provides functionality to store the following files:
    - `ab_upt_cp=E10_... model.th`: encoder weights after 10 epochs
    - `ab_upt_cp=E20_... model.th`: encoder weights after 20 epochs
    - `ab_upt_cp=E30_... model.th`: encoder weights after 30 epochs
    - `ab_upt_cp=last_model.th`: latest encoder weights
    - `ab_upt_cp=last_optim.th`: latest encoder optimizer state


    Each model checkpoint is populated with metadata. Each checkpoint will be a dictionary containing the keys:
    - "state_dict": Weights of the model.
    - "model_config": The model configuration used to instantiate the model. A serialized dict of the pydantic model config.
    - "checkpoint_tag": The name of the checkpoint. E.g., E10_U200_S800 for a progress-based checkpoint or "latest" for a
      string-based checkpoint.
    - "training_iteration": The detailed information about training iteration as a dict with keys 'epoch', 'update', and 'sample'.
      E.g., for the "latest" checkpoint you would not know from which epoch the checkpoint is, therefore
      the "training_iteration" field of that checkpoint contains "E13_U..._S...".
    - "run_id": The ID of the run from which it was created.
