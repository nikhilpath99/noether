The Multi-Stage Pipeline
========================

The multi-stage pipeline serves as the interface between the dataset class and the model/trainer
(discussed in :doc:`trainer`). It defines how to combine individual samples from the dataset
into batches that are fed to the model. Each batch contains the model inputs for the forward
pass and the corresponding targets needed to compute the loss.

The multi-stage pipeline has three sequential stages:

#. **Sample processor pipeline**: Sample processors act on individual data samples (i.e., data points).
#. **Collation**: The collator pipeline collates individual samples into a batch.
#. **Batch processor pipeline**: Batch processors act on the entire batch.

This sequential processing gives the **multi-stage pipeline** its name. In this project, most
of the computation occurs during the sample processing stage.

A basic implementation of a custom :py:class:`~noether.data.pipeline.MultiStagePipeline` looks
like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from noether.data.pipeline import MultiStagePipeline

   class CustomMultiStagePipeline(MultiStagePipeline):
       def __init__(self, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(
               preprocessors=[],
               collators=[],
               postprocessors=[],
               **kwargs,
           )

You need to provide three lists to the multi-stage pipeline (which are all empty in the example
above): one for sample processors, one for collators, and one for batch processors. The
``MultiStagePipeline`` iterates through each list sequentially. The output from one processor
becomes the input for the next, making the order of operations **crucial** for all three stages.

Sample processors
-----------------

To understand the
``AeroMultistagePipeline`` (in ``pipeline/multistage_pipelines/aero_multistage.py``),
it's essential to understand the data processing flow for this project.

We're dealing with CFD aerodynamic simulations that have both a surface and a volume mesh/field.
Each point in these fields has three coordinates ``(x, y, z)``, one or more target values (e.g.,
``pressure``, ``velocity``, ``vorticity``, ``wallshear stress``, etc.), and potentially
additional features (e.g., ``SDF``, surface/volume normals). The target values and features can
vary depending on whether the point belongs to the surface or volume and which dataset is used.
From now on, we'll refer to these additional features as **physics features**. We do not
consider global features for this project.

The data structure for our tasks is defined in, for example,
:source:`configs/data_specs/shapenet_car.yaml <../../../../recipes/aero_cfd/configs/data_specs/shapenet_car.yaml>`,
which corresponds to the ``ModelDataSpecs`` schema.

The models we use can be roughly **divided** into two classes:

#. **Point-based models**, where the input points to the model's encoder are also the points
   used for predicting the output values (e.g., ``Transformer``, ``Transolver``).
#. **Query-based models**, which use additional query points (distinct from the input points)
   for predicting output values (e.g., ``UPT``, ``AB-UPT``).

This means we have to build a multi-stage pipeline that works for both point-based and
query-based models.

We will now outline the sample processor pipeline required for these models:

#. Some input tensors have **constant** values. For example, the ``SDF`` for the surface mesh is
   always zero. Therefore, we first create **default tensors** if needed. Because this step
   occurs before batch collation, it's considered a **sample processing** step.
#. Next, we subsample the entire simulation mesh to a specified number of surface and volume
   points and, if used, query points. For both input and query points, we define how many to
   sample from the surface and how many from the volume. If we train AB-UPT, we sample anchor
   points instead of input/query points.
#. If we use query points, their corresponding physical quantities become the model's prediction
   targets. If we only use input points, their values are the output targets (labels). Hence, we
   need to rename the relevant values to ``targets`` based on whether the model uses input points
   or query points for its predictions.

The high-level pipeline is visualized in the image below:

   Pipeline data flow for the ShapeNet-Car models.

This entire pipeline is implemented in the ``_build_sample_processor_pipeline`` method in the
``AeroMultistagePipeline`` class, which composes the list of sample processor classes based on
the three steps listed above. This method returns a list of individual
:py:class:`~noether.data.pipeline.SampleProcessor` instances. Each sample processor takes a sample as input (which is a dictionary with the result
of all the ``getitem_*`` methods called by the dataset for one data point) and does some form
of processing on one or more tensors of the sample. Note that the order is important, as the
sample processors are called sequentially.

When the multi-stage pipeline runs, the sample processors are called as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/noether/data/pipeline/multistage.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 103-107
   :dedent:

Each **sample processor** takes a sample as input and returns the (pre)processed sample.
Each ``SampleProcessor`` must implement the
``__call__(self, sample: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]`` method. This method receives a
dictionary containing the sample's tensors as input. The ``SampleProcessor``'s goal is to apply
a specific processing step to the corresponding values for one or more keys in the sample
dictionary.

For a guide on writing sample processors, see
:doc:`/guides/data/how_to_write_a_sample_processor`.


Collators
---------

The code for calling the collators in the multi-stage pipeline looks as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/noether/data/pipeline/multistage.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 109-117
   :dedent:

Each collator defines how to merge certain keys from each sample into a batch. In most cases,
the :py:class:`~noether.data.pipeline.collators.DefaultCollator`, where tensors are simply
concatenated along the batch dimension, will suffice. However, when creating sparse tensors, for example, a more sophisticated collation
approach is required. We define the collator pipeline in the ``_build_collator_pipeline`` method.
Only when dealing with supernodes do we require additional collator classes such as the
:py:class:`~noether.data.pipeline.collators.SparseTensorOffsetCollator` (e.g., for AB-UPT and
UPT).


Batch processors
----------------

In this project, we do not use any batch processors. Nevertheless, they work in the same way as
sample processors. However, instead of processing individual samples, they process the collated
batch. Below is the code showing how batch processors are called:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../src/noether/data/pipeline/multistage.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 119-121
   :dedent:
