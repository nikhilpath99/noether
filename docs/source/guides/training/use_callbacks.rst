How to Use and Build Callbacks
===============================

Callbacks are the primary mechanism in the **Noether Framework** that allow you to inject custom logic into various stages of the training process. They are primarily used for monitoring, checkpointing, evaluation, and experiment tracking.

What are Callbacks?
-------------------

In Noether, a callback is a class that inherits from :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.base.CallbackBase`. These objects provide hooks that the trainer calls at specific points:

*   **Before training starts**: Initialization, logging hyperparameters, or printing model summaries.
*   **After each accumulation step**: Tracking metrics across multiple batches.
*   **After each optimizer update**: Updating learning rate schedules or tracking update-level metrics.
*   **After each epoch**: Performing validation or saving periodic checkpoints.
*   **After training ends**: Final evaluation, saving final results, or cleanup.
*   **At evaluation time**: Running inference on validation or test datasets.

Types of Callbacks
------------------

Noether provides several base classes and a wide range of built-in callbacks.


Pre/Post Training Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These callbacks inherit directly from :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.base.CallbackBase` and are designed to run logic only once at the start or end of training. Examples include logging hyperparameters before training or saving final results after training.

Periodic Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most callbacks during training are **periodic**. Inheriting from :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.periodic.PeriodicCallback` allows you to configure how often a callback should run using one of the following intervals:

*   ``every_n_epochs``: Runs after every $N$ epochs.
*   ``every_n_updates``: Runs after every $N$ optimizer steps.
*   ``every_n_samples``: Runs after every $N$ training samples have been processed.


Periodic Data Iterator Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For tasks that require iterating over an entire dataset (like validation or computing complex metrics on a test set), Noether provides :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.periodic.PeriodicDataIteratorCallback`. 

This class handles:

*   Distributed data sampling across multiple GPUs.
*   Automatic collation of results from different ranks.
*   Integration with the training data pipeline.

Commonly Used Callbacks
-----------------------

Noether includes many pre-defined callbacks organized by their purpose:

   * - Category
     - Examples and Usage
   * - **Monitoring**
     - :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.ProgressCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.DatasetStatsCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.LrCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.PeakMemoryCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.OnlineLossCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.ParamCountCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.EtaCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.default.TrainTimeCallback`. Used for real-time tracking of training progress and hardware usage. These callbacks are all initialized by default by the :class:`~noether.training.trainers.BaseTrainer`, the user does not need to add them manually.
   * - **Checkpointing**
     - :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.checkpoint.best_checkpoint.BestCheckpointCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.checkpoint.checkpoint.CheckpointCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.checkpoint.ema.EmaCallback`. Used to save model weights periodically or when a new best metric is achieved.
   * - **Early Stopping**
     - :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.early_stoppers.metric.MetricEarlyStopper`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.early_stoppers.fixed.FixedEarlyStopper`. Used to stop training automatically if progress plateaus.
   * - **Evaluation**
     - :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.online.best_metric.BestMetricCallback`, :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.online.track_outputs. TrackOutputsCallback`. Specialized monitoring for tracked metrics.

Evaluating Against EMA Weights
------------------------------

:class:`~noether.core.callbacks.checkpoint.ema.EmaCallback` maintains exponential moving averages of the model weights and checkpoints them to disk. It can also own a list of nested periodic callbacks via the ``eval_callbacks`` field. At each eval-time hook the EMA weights are swapped into the live model, the nested callbacks are dispatched (so they run against EMA weights), and the live weights are restored.

Children keep their own schedule (``every_n_epochs`` etc.), run once per ``target_factor``, and have their logged metric keys auto-prefixed with ``ema=<factor>/`` to avoid collisions with live-model metrics.

.. code-block:: yaml

   - kind: noether.core.callbacks.EmaCallback
     every_n_epochs: 10
     target_factors: [0.9999]
     save_latest_weights: true
     eval_callbacks:
       - kind: noether.training.callbacks.OfflineLossCallback
         every_n_epochs: 1
         dataset_key: val
       # logs as ``ema=0.9999/loss/val/total``

When to Use What?
-----------------

1.  **Use existing callbacks** for standard tasks like logging, checkpointing, and validation. These are highly configurable via YAML.
2.  **Inherit from** :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.periodic.PeriodicCallback` if you need to perform an action at regular intervals (e.g., logging a custom internal state of the model).
3.  **Inherit from** :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.periodic.PeriodicDataIteratorCallback` if you need to run inference on a specific dataset and aggregate the results to compute a metric. Those callbacks need to configure a dataset key to specify which dataset to run on.
4.  **Inherit from** :class:`~noether.core.callbacks.base.CallbackBase` if your logic only needs to run once at the very beginning or end of training.

How to Configure Callbacks
--------------------------

Callbacks are usually defined in your experiment configuration under the ``callbacks`` key. Each callback requires the fully qualified class name  (e.g., ``noether.core.callbacks.progress.Progress``) as the ``kind``, exactly one frequency setting (``every_n_*``) and any additional parameters specific to that callback.

Example YAML configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   callbacks:
    - kind: noether.core.callbacks.CallbackClassName
      name: CallbackInstanceName
      every_n_epochs: 1
      # or every_n_updates: 1
      # additional_param: value


How to Implement Custom Callbacks
---------------------------------

To create a custom callback, define a new class that inherits from one of the base callback classes. Override the relevant methods to inject your logic at the desired points in the training process.


.. testcode::

   import torch
   from noether.core.schemas.callbacks import PeriodicDataIteratorCallbackConfig
   from noether.core.callbacks.periodic import PeriodicCallback

   class CustomCallbackConfig(PeriodicDataIteratorCallbackConfig):
       pass  # Define any configuration parameters your callback needs

   class MyCustomCallback(PeriodicCallback):
       def __init__(self, callback_config: CustomCallbackConfig, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(callback_config, **kwargs)

       def process_data(self, batch: dict[str, torch.Tensor], **_) -> dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
           model_output = self.model(**batch)
           # some more custom logic
           out = {"custom_output": model_output}
           return out

       def process_results(self, results: dict[str, torch.Tensor], **_) -> None:
           # this method gets the aggregated results of the process_data method across the dataset
           # do something with the results
           self.writer.add_scalar("custom_metric", results["custom_output"].mean().item())

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   _cfg = CustomCallbackConfig(dataset_key="test", every_n_epochs=1)
